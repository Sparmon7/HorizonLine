# HorizonLine

Spencer Armon (501508) and Josh Sapira (501443) </br>

We trained a convolutional neural network to identify horizon lines in images. The *windows* branch serves as the main repository for this, which works well on windows operating systems, and the *retrain-model-clean* branch works on apple operating systems.
We got our data from Nathan Jacobs, co-author of Horizon Lines in the Wild. This paper is cited below </br>
